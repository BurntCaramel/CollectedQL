### Process JavaScript using Rollup

- Use Rollup’s `this.parse(code: string, acornOptions: AcornOptions) => ESTree.Program`

### Server rendering without the headaches

Server render React, Preact, or your favorite JavaScript framework. There’s no Node.js instances to manage, as Cloudflare Workers automatically scales V8 instances for you.

### Process on the fly

Render Markdown & HTML templates, call APIs, process data, validate signatures, and more. Cloudflare Workers have a full JavaScript environment.

### Immutable content

Text and images are stored by their address. The same content has the same address. This means content is efficiently de-duped and reused.
